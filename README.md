### 📝 User Stories

#### Core

- [x] As an opinionated person, I want to: post my thoughts so others can read them
- [x] As a bored person, I want to: read what other people have posted

#### Stretch

- [x] As a user, I want to: submit information to your site for anyone to see
- [x] As a user, I want to: come back to your site later and see what I posted is still there

### Acceptance Criteria ✅

### 🧪 Testing
